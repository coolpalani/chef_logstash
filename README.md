# chef_logstash cookbook

This is a Library Style cookbook that provides Chef Resource Providers to create and
manage your [Logstash](http://logstash.net/) environment.

# Requirements

The following cookbooks are suggested to use this cookbook:

  + [java::openjdk](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/java)
  + [runit](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/runit)

# Usage

# Resources and Providers

## logstash_instance
The intention is to provide a stable interface to creating instances of
Logstash on your servers. This means creating a instance via
`logstash_instance` will download, install, and setup a functional
instance of Logstash but it does not handle any configuration details.

The following actions are supported and `:create` is the default:

 + `:create` - Creates a named instance of Logstash. This action will
download logstash `:version` to the `:dst_dir`. It creates the `:user`
and `:group` used to run Logstash. And finally it creates the `runit`
resource required to manage the service. It does not _start_ the service
as that is a job for `:enable`.

 + `:enable` - Enables the specified `service_type` or the default `init`.
 + `:update` -
 + `:destroy` -
 + `:nothing` -

These attributes are defined in the resource:

 + `:name`
 + `:user`
 + `:group`
 + `:conf_dir`
 + `:dst_dir`
 + `:service_type` -
 + `:service_options` -
 + `:install_type` -
 + `:install_options` -

Usage example:

    logstash_instance 'default' do
      install_options({
        url:      node.logstash.install_options.fetch(:url)
        checksum: node.logstash.install_options.fetch(:checksum)
        version:  node.logstash.install_options.fetch(:version)
      })
      action   [:create, :enable]
    end

## logstash_config

The following actions are supported and `:create` is the default:

 + `:create` - Creates a named configuration for a specific Logstash plugin.
This action will create a sub-resource based on the `plugin_type` and `plugin`
specified. The `plugin_config` attribute will be passed to the sub-resource
during resource creation. We use the `instance` attribute to link this
configuration to a specific Logstash instance.
 + `:enable` - Ensures the configuration for the specified instance has been loaded.
 + `:update` -
 + `:destroy` - Remove the named configuration.
 + `:nothing` - Does nothing, except define the resource with the associated
attributes.

These attributes are defined in the resource:

 + `:instance` - The Logstash instance this plugin is associated with.
 + `:plugin` - One of the numerous [Logstash plugins](http://logstash.net/docs/1.1.9/).
 + `:plugin_type` - Accepts one of 'input', 'filter', 'output'
 + `:plugin_config`- A hash containing the key-value pairs that configure
the plugin.

Usage example:

    logstash_config 'httpd_log_files' do
      instance    'default'
      plugin      'file'
      plugin_type 'input'
      plugin_config({
        path: ['/var/log/httpd/*_log'],
        type: 'httpd'
      })
      action [:create, :enable]
    end
